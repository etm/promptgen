First, a script task with the id a1 occurs. Subsequently an infinite loop (no condidition) occurs. Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a5 and the label "B" which calls the endpoint timeout. It is called with the following parameters: timeout is "1". Then an exclusive decision with 2 branches occurs. The only entry in the first decision branch is a task with the id a8 and the label "C". The only entry in the second decision branch is a task with the id a9 and the label "D". At this point all decision branches are finished, and the process ends.
