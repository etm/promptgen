Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a5 and the label "B" which calls the endpoint timeout. It is called with the following parameters: timeout is "1"Afterwards, this is followed by an exclusive decision with 2 branches. This decision will be furthermore refered to as D1. The first branch of D1 is executed if the condition is "". The only entry in the first branch of D1 is a task with the id a8 and the label "C". The second branch of D1 is executed if the condition is "". The only entry in the second branch of D1 is a task with the id a9 and the label "D". At this point all branches of D1 are finished, and the process ends.
