First, a task with the id a2239 and the label "Read order from system" occurs. Subsequently a loop, which starts if the condition "Product not in stock" is met, occurs. Subsequently a task with the id a2245 and the label "Reorder product from wholesaler" occurs. Subsequently, this is followed by an exclusive decision with 2 branches. This decision will be furthermore refered to as D1. The first branch of D1 is executed if the condition is "Wait more than 10 days". The only entry in the first branch of D1 is a task with the id a2249 and the label "Demand penalty from wholesaler". The second branch of D1 is executed if the condition is "Wait less than 10 days".

Then an exclusive decision with 2 branches occurs. This decision will be furthermore refered to as D2. The first branch of D2 is executed if the condition is "Order not ready for shipment". The only entry in the first branch of D2 is a task with the id a2261 and the label "Select next product". The second branch of D2 is executed if the condition is "". The first entry in in the second branch of D2 is a parallel gateway with 2 branches, furthermore dubbed PG1,. The first entry in in the first parallel branch of PG1 is a task with the id a2263 and the label "Request courier". The first entry in in the second parallel branch of PG1 is a task with the id a2265 and the label "Pack products". At this point the branches of PG1 are joined. At this point we escape the innermost loop. At this point all branches of D2 are finished. Then a task with the id a2243 and the label "Withdraw product from warehouse" occurs.
