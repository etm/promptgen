First, a task with the id a2741 and the label "Customer logs into E-Shop" occurs. Subsequently a task with the id a2743 and the label "System checks credentials" occurs. Then an exclusive decision with 2 branches occurs. This decision will be furthermore refered to as D1. The first branch of D1 is executed if the condition is "Login Successful". The only entry in the first branch of D1 is an infinite loop (no condidition). The only entry in the first branch of D1 is a task with the id a2747 and the label "Customer selects products". The only entry in the first branch of D1 is a task with the id a2751 and the label "Add product to cart". The only entry in the first branch of D1 is a task with the id a2753 and the label "Save product". The only entry in the first branch of D1 is a loop, which starts if the condition "Not all products selected" is met,. The only entry in the first branch of D1 is a task with the id a2747 and the label "Customer selects products". The only entry in the first branch of D1 is a task with the id a2751 and the label "Add product to cart". The only entry in the first branch of D1 is a task with the id a2753 and the label "Save product". The only entry in the first branch of D1 is a task with the id a2757 and the label "Finish order". The only entry in the first branch of D1 is a parallel gateway with 2 branches, furthermore dubbed PG1,. The first entry in in the first parallel branch of PG1 is a task with the id a2763 and the label "Enter payment data". Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a2767 and the label "Wait for bank confirmation". The first entry in in the second parallel branch of PG1 is a task with the id a2765 and the label "Enter shipping address". At this point the branches of PG1 are joined. The second branch of D1 is executed if the condition is "Login Unsuccessful". At this point all branches of D1 are finished, and the process ends.
