First, a task with the id a1 and the label "Send Invitations" occurs. Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a3 and the label "Find out which games to play". Subsequently, this is followed by an infinite loop (no condidition). Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a5 and the label "Appoint a date for LAN party". Then a loop, which starts if the condition "Less than 8 agree" is met, occurs. Then a task with the id a5 and the label "Appoint a date for LAN party" occurs. Subsequently a task with the id a9 and the label "Check if all games are available" occurs. Afterwards, this is followed by an exclusive decision with 2 branches. The first decision branch is executed if the condition is "All games are available". The second decision branch is executed if the condition is "Some games are missing". The only entry in the second decision branch is a task with the id a17 and the label "Download missing games". At this point all decision branches are finished. Then a task with the id a15 and the label "Find out beer requirement" occurs. Afterwards, this is followed by an exclusive decision with 2 branches. The first decision branch is executed if the condition is "Enough beer available". The second decision branch is executed if the condition is "Not enough beer". The only entry in the second decision branch is a task with the id a25 and the label "Buy missing beer". At this point all decision branches are finished, and the process ends.
