First, a task with the id a1 and the label "Send Invitations" occurs. Then a task with the id a3 and the label "Find out which games to play" occurs. Then an infinite loop (no condidition) occurs. Then a task with the id a5 and the label "Appoint a date for LAN party" occurs. Then a loop, which starts if the condition "Less than 8 agree" is met, occurs. Then a task with the id a5 and the label "Appoint a date for LAN party" occurs. Then a task with the id a9 and the label "Check if all games are available" occurs. Then an exclusive decision with 2 branches occurs. The first decision branch is executed if the condition is "All games are available". The second decision branch is executed if the condition is "Some games are missing". The only entry in the second decision branch is a task with the id a17 and the label "Download missing games". At this point all decision branches are finished. Then a task with the id a15 and the label "Find out beer requirement" occurs. Then an exclusive decision with 2 branches occurs.
