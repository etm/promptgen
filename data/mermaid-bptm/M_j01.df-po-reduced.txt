First, an infinite loop (no condidition) occurs. Subsequently a task with the id a1411 and the label "Customer provides chainsaw properties" occurs. Afterwards, this is followed by a parallel gateway with 3 branches. The first entry in in the first parallel branch is a task with the id a1415 and the label "Order guide bar". The first entry in in the second parallel branch is a task with the id a1417 and the label "Order chain width". The first entry in in the third parallel branch is a task with the id a1419 and the label "Order chainsaw type". At this point the parallel branches are joined. Subsequently a task with the id a1427 and the label "Inspect parts" occurs. Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a1429 and the label "Assemble chainsaw". Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a1431 and the label "Send updates to customer". Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a1433 and the label "Send first chainsaw to customer". Then an infinite loop (no condidition) occurs. Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a1439 and the label "Adjust chainsaw properties". Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a1411 and the label "Customer provides chainsaw properties". Afterwards, this is followed by a parallel gateway with 3 branches. The first entry in in the first parallel branch is a task with the id a1415 and the label "Order guide bar". The first entry in in the second parallel branch is a task with the id a1417 and the label "Order chain width". The first entry in in the third parallel branch is a task with the id a1419 and the label "Order chainsaw type". At this point the parallel branches are joined. Subsequently a task with the id a1427 and the label "Inspect parts" occurs. Then a task with the id a1429 and the label "Assemble chainsaw" occurs. Subsequently a task with the id a1431 and the label "Send updates to customer" occurs. Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a1433 and the label "Send first chainsaw to customer". Subsequently a task with the id a1437 and the label "Produce rest of order" occurs, and the process ends.
