First, an infinite loop (no condidition) occurs. Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a1143 and the label "Customer provides chainsaw properties". Then a parallel gateway with 3 branches occurs. The first entry in in the first parallel branch is a task with the id a1147 and the label "Order guide bar". The first entry in in the second parallel branch is a task with the id a1149 and the label "Order chain width". The first entry in in the third parallel branch is a task with the id a1151 and the label "Order chainsaw type". At this point the parallel branches are joined. Subsequently a task with the id a1159 and the label "Inspect parts" occurs. Subsequently a task with the id a1161 and the label "Assemble chainsaw" occurs. Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a1163 and the label "Send updates to customer". Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a1165 and the label "Send first chainsaw to customer". Subsequently, this is followed by an infinite loop (no condidition). Subsequently a task with the id a1171 and the label "Adjust chainsaw properties" occurs. Then a task with the id a1143 and the label "Customer provides chainsaw properties" occurs. Subsequently a parallel gateway with 3 branches occurs. The first entry in in the first parallel branch is a task with the id a1147 and the label "Order guide bar". The first entry in in the second parallel branch is a task with the id a1149 and the label "Order chain width". The first entry in in the third parallel branch is a task with the id a1151 and the label "Order chainsaw type". At this point the parallel branches are joined. Subsequently a task with the id a1159 and the label "Inspect parts" occurs. Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a1161 and the label "Assemble chainsaw". Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a1163 and the label "Send updates to customer". Subsequently a task with the id a1165 and the label "Send first chainsaw to customer" occurs. Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a1169 and the label "Produce rest of order", and the process ends.
