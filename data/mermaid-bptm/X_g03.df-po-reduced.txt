First, a task with the id a1 and the label "Select a starting block" occurs. Then a task with the id a3 and the label "Run for 5km and measure the time" occurs. Subsequently a loop, which starts if the condition "Time more than 25 minutes" is met, occurs. Subsequently a task with the id a9 and the label "Train and check until goal is achieved" occurs. Then a task with the id a7 and the label "Get your starting number" occurs. Afterwards, this is followed by an exclusive decision with 2 branches. The first decision branch is executed if the condition is "More than one hour left after work". The only entry in the first decision branch is a task with the id a15 and the label "Go there from home". The second decision branch is executed if the condition is "Less than one hour left after work". The only entry in the second decision branch is a task with the id a17 and the label "Leave directly from work". At this point all decision branches are finished. Then a task with the id a19 and the label "Run and drink at the Night Run" occurs. Subsequently a task with the id a25 and the label "Receive your final running time" occurs, and the process ends.
