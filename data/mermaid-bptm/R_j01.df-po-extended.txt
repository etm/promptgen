First, an infinite loop (no condidition) occurs. Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a2087 and the label "Collect machine information". Subsequently, this is followed by an infinite loop (no condidition). Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a2089 and the label "Calculate OEE". Then an pre_test decision with 2 branches occurs. This decision will be furthermore refered to as D1. The first branch of D1 is executed if the condition is "OEE below threshold". The first entry in in the first branch of D1 is a task with the id a2093 and the label "Stop machine". Subsequently a task with the id a2097 and the label "Send email to engineer" occurs. Subsequently, this is followed by an exclusive decision with 2 branches. This decision will be furthermore refered to as D2. The first branch of D2 is executed if the condition is "Machine restarted". The first entry in in the first branch of D2 is a task with the id a2087 and the label "Collect machine information". Then a task with the id a2089 and the label "Calculate OEE" occurs. The second branch of D2 is executed if the condition is "Machine disconnected". At this point we escape the innermost loop. At this point all branches of D2 are finished. The second branch of D1 is executed if the condition is "OEE above threshold". The only entry in the second branch of D1 is a task with the id a2089 and the label "Calculate OEE". At this point all branches of D1 are finished, and the process ends.
