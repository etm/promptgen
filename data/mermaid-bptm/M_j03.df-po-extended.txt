First, a task with the id a1 and the label "Query all web shops for parts" occurs. Then an exclusive decision with 2 branches occurs. This decision will be furthermore refered to as D1. The first branch of D1 is executed if the condition is "If shop has enough parts". The only entry in the first branch of D1 is a task with the id a5 and the label "Order parts from cheapest shop". The second branch of D1 is executed if the condition is "If shop doesn't have enough parts". The only entry in the second branch of D1 is a task with the id a7 and the label "Order parts from several shops". At this point all branches of D1 are finished. Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a9 and the label "Wait for parts to arrive". Subsequently a task with the id a13 and the label "Start building when first parts arrive" occurs. Then an pre_test decision with 3 branches occurs. This decision will be furthermore refered to as D2. The first branch of D2 is executed if the condition is "If stock falls below 5". The only entry in the first branch of D2 is a task with the id a17 and the label "Reorder cheapest parts". The second branch of D2 is executed if the condition is "If stock falls below 3". The only entry in the second branch of D2 is a task with the id a19 and the label "Reorder fastest parts". The third branch of D2 is executed if the condition is "". At this point we escape the innermost loop. At this point all branches of D2 are finished. Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a21 and the label "Write a mail complaining about webshops", and the process ends.
