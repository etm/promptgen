First, a task with the id a1997 and the label "Query all web shops for parts" occurs. Afterwards, this is followed by an exclusive decision with 2 branches. This decision will be furthermore refered to as D1. The first branch of D1 is executed if the condition is "If shop has enough parts". The only entry in the first branch of D1 is a task with the id a2001 and the label "Order parts from cheapest shop". The second branch of D1 is executed if the condition is "If shop doesn't have enough parts". The only entry in the second branch of D1 is a task with the id a2003 and the label "Order parts from several shops". At this point all branches of D1 are finished. Then a task with the id a2005 and the label "Wait for parts to arrive" occurs. Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a2009 and the label "Start building when first parts arrive". Then an pre_test decision with 3 branches occurs. This decision will be furthermore refered to as D2. The first branch of D2 is executed if the condition is "If stock falls below 5". The only entry in the first branch of D2 is a task with the id a2013 and the label "Reorder cheapest parts". The second branch of D2 is executed if the condition is "If stock falls below 3". The only entry in the second branch of D2 is a task with the id a2015 and the label "Reorder fastest parts". The third branch of D2 is executed if the condition is "". At this point we escape the innermost loop. At this point all branches of D2 are finished. Subsequently a task with the id a2017 and the label "Write a mail complaining about webshops" occurs, and the process ends.
