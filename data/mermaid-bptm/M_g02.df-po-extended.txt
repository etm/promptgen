First, a task with the id a1913 and the label "Develop Basic Design" occurs. Then a task with the id a1915 and the label "Order Lego Brick Sets" occurs. Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a1917 and the label "Sort Lego Parts". Subsequently, this is followed by an infinite loop (no condidition). Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a1919 and the label "Build Subcomponents". Afterwards, this is followed by a loop, which starts if the condition "No more parts" is met,. Subsequently a task with the id a1923 and the label "Reorder Parts" occurs. Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a1919 and the label "Build Subcomponents". Then an infinite loop (no condidition) occurs. Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a1927 and the label "Test Subcomponents". Then a loop, which starts if the condition "Test Failed" is met, occurs. Then a task with the id a1931 and the label "Redesign and Rebuild" occurs. Subsequently a task with the id a1927 and the label "Test Subcomponents" occurs. Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a1935 and the label "Assemble Subcomponents", and the process ends.
