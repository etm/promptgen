First, a task with the id a1 and the label "Send Invitations" occurs. Then a task with the id a3 and the label "Find out which games to play" occurs. Afterwards, this is followed by an infinite loop (no condidition). Then a task with the id a5 and the label "Appoint a date for LAN party" occurs. Then a loop, which starts if the condition "Less than 8 agree" is met, occurs. Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a5 and the label "Appoint a date for LAN party". Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a9 and the label "Check if all games are available". Afterwards, this is followed by an exclusive decision with 2 branches. This decision will be furthermore refered to as D1. The first branch of D1 is executed if the condition is "All games are available". The second branch of D1 is executed if the condition is "Some games are missing". The only entry in the second branch of D1 is a task with the id a17 and the label "Download missing games". At this point all branches of D1 are finished. Subsequently a task with the id a15 and the label "Find out beer requirement" occurs. Subsequently an exclusive decision with 2 branches occurs. This decision will be furthermore refered to as D2. The first branch of D2 is executed if the condition is "Enough beer available". The second branch of D2 is executed if the condition is "Not enough beer". The only entry in the second branch of D2 is a task with the id a25 and the label "Buy missing beer". At this point all branches of D2 are finished, and the process ends.
