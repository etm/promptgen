The process contains the following main elements:
  * an infinite loop (no condidition), furthermore referred to as L1.
The loop L1 contains the following elements:
  * a task with the id a1 and the label "Customer provides chainsaw properties"
  * a parallel gateway with 3 branches, furthermore dubbed PG1. 
  * a task with the id a17 and the label "Inspect parts"
  * a task with the id a19 and the label "Assemble chainsaw"
  * a task with the id a21 and the label "Send updates to customer"
  * a task with the id a23 and the label "Send first chainsaw to customer"
  * an infinite loop (no condidition), furthermore referred to as L2.
  * a task with the id a27 and the label "Produce rest of order"
The first branch of PG1 contains the following elements:
  * a task with the id a5 and the label "Order guide bar"
The second branch of PG1 contains the following elements:
  * a task with the id a7 and the label "Order chain width"
The third branch of PG1 contains the following elements:
  * a task with the id a9 and the label "Order chainsaw type"
The loop L2 contains the following elements:
  * a task with the id a29 and the label "Adjust chainsaw properties"
  * a task with the id a1 and the label "Customer provides chainsaw properties"
  * a parallel gateway with 3 branches, furthermore dubbed PG2. 
  * a task with the id a17 and the label "Inspect parts"
  * a task with the id a19 and the label "Assemble chainsaw"
  * a task with the id a21 and the label "Send updates to customer"
  * a task with the id a23 and the label "Send first chainsaw to customer"
The first branch of PG2 contains the following elements:
  * a task with the id a5 and the label "Order guide bar"
The second branch of PG2 contains the following elements:
  * a task with the id a7 and the label "Order chain width"
The third branch of PG2 contains the following elements:
  * a task with the id a9 and the label "Order chainsaw type"
After this the process ends.
