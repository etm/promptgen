First, a task with the id a1409 and the label "Customer logs into E-Shop" occurs. Subsequently a task with the id a1411 and the label "System checks credentials" occurs. Then an exclusive decision with 2 branches occurs. The first decision branch is executed if the condition is "Login Successful". The only entry in the first decision branch is an infinite loop (no condidition). The only entry in the first decision branch is a task with the id a1415 and the label "Customer selects products". The only entry in the first decision branch is a task with the id a1419 and the label "Add product to cart". The only entry in the first decision branch is a task with the id a1421 and the label "Save product". The only entry in the first decision branch is a loop, which starts if the condition "Not all products selected" is met,. The only entry in the first decision branch is a task with the id a1415 and the label "Customer selects products". The only entry in the first decision branch is a task with the id a1419 and the label "Add product to cart". The only entry in the first decision branch is a task with the id a1421 and the label "Save product". The only entry in the first decision branch is a task with the id a1425 and the label "Finish order". The only entry in the first decision branch is a parallel gateway with 2 branches. The first entry in in the first parallel branch is a task with the id a1431 and the label "Enter payment data". Then a task with the id a1435 and the label "Wait for bank confirmation" occurs. The first entry in in the second parallel branch is a task with the id a1433 and the label "Enter shipping address". At this point the parallel branches are joined. The second decision branch is executed if the condition is "Login Unsuccessful". At this point all decision branches are finished, and the process ends.
