First, a task with the id a1385 and the label "Develop Basic Design" occurs. Then a task with the id a1387 and the label "Order Lego Brick Sets" occurs. Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a1389 and the label "Sort Lego Parts". Afterwards, this is followed by an infinite loop (no condidition). Then a task with the id a1391 and the label "Build Subcomponents" occurs. Afterwards, this is followed by a loop, which starts if the condition "No more parts" is met,. Subsequently a task with the id a1395 and the label "Reorder Parts" occurs. Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a1391 and the label "Build Subcomponents". Subsequently, this is followed by an infinite loop (no condidition). Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a1399 and the label "Test Subcomponents". Afterwards, this is followed by a loop, which starts if the condition "Test Failed" is met,. Subsequently a task with the id a1403 and the label "Redesign and Rebuild" occurs. Subsequently a task with the id a1399 and the label "Test Subcomponents" occurs. Subsequently a task with the id a1407 and the label "Assemble Subcomponents" occurs, and the process ends.
