First, a task with the id a1 and the label "Develop Basic Design" occurs. Then a task with the id a3 and the label "Order Lego Brick Sets" occurs. Then a task with the id a5 and the label "Sort Lego Parts" occurs. Then an infinite loop (no condidition) occurs. Then a task with the id a7 and the label "Build Subcomponents" occurs. Then a loop, which starts if the condition "No more parts" is met, occurs. Then a task with the id a11 and the label "Reorder Parts" occurs. Then a task with the id a7 and the label "Build Subcomponents" occurs. Then an infinite loop (no condidition) occurs. Then a task with the id a15 and the label "Test Subcomponents" occurs. Then a loop, which starts if the condition "Test Failed" is met, occurs. Then a task with the id a19 and the label "Redesign and Rebuild" occurs. Then a task with the id a15 and the label "Test Subcomponents" occurs. Then a task with the id a23 and the label "Assemble Subcomponents" occurs, and the process ends.
