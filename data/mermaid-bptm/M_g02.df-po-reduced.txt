First, a task with the id a1117 and the label "Develop Basic Design" occurs. Then a task with the id a1119 and the label "Order Lego Brick Sets" occurs. Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a1121 and the label "Sort Lego Parts". Subsequently an infinite loop (no condidition) occurs. Then a task with the id a1123 and the label "Build Subcomponents" occurs. Then a loop, which starts if the condition "No more parts" is met, occurs. Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a1127 and the label "Reorder Parts". Subsequently a task with the id a1123 and the label "Build Subcomponents" occurs. Then an infinite loop (no condidition) occurs. Then a task with the id a1131 and the label "Test Subcomponents" occurs. Then a loop, which starts if the condition "Test Failed" is met, occurs. Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a1135 and the label "Redesign and Rebuild". Then a task with the id a1131 and the label "Test Subcomponents" occurs. Subsequently a task with the id a1139 and the label "Assemble Subcomponents" occurs, and the process ends.
