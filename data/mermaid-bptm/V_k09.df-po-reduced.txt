First, a task with the id a1443 and the label "Read order from system" occurs. Afterwards, this is followed by a loop, which starts if the condition "Product not in stock" is met,. Then a task with the id a1449 and the label "Reorder product from wholesaler" occurs. Afterwards, this is followed by an exclusive decision with 2 branches. The first decision branch is executed if the condition is "Wait more than 10 days". The only entry in the first decision branch is a task with the id a1453 and the label "Demand penalty from wholesaler". The second decision branch is executed if the condition is "Wait less than 10 days". At this point all decision branches are finished. Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a1455 and the label "Register product in stock management system". Subsequently, this is followed by an exclusive decision with 2 branches. The first decision branch is executed if the condition is "Order not ready for shipment". The only entry in the first decision branch is a task with the id a1465 and the label "Select next product". The second decision branch is executed if the condition is "". The first entry in in the second decision branch is a parallel gateway with 2 branches. The first entry in in the first parallel branch is a task with the id a1467 and the label "Request courier". The first entry in in the second parallel branch is a task with the id a1469 and the label "Pack products". At this point the parallel branches are joined. At this point we escape the innermost loop. At this point all decision branches are finished. Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a1447 and the label "Withdraw product from warehouse".
