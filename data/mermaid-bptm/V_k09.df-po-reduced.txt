First, a task with the id a1 and the label "Read order from system" occurs. Then a loop, which starts if the condition "Product not in stock" is met, occurs. Subsequently a task with the id a7 and the label "Reorder product from wholesaler" occurs. Subsequently, this is followed by an exclusive decision with 2 branches. The first decision branch is executed if the condition is "Wait more than 10 days". The only entry in the first decision branch is a task with the id a11 and the label "Demand penalty from wholesaler". The second decision branch is executed if the condition is "Wait less than 10 days". At this point all decision branches are finished. Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a13 and the label "Register product in stock management system". Subsequently, this is followed by an exclusive decision with 2 branches. The first decision branch is executed if the condition is "Order not ready for shipment". The only entry in the first decision branch is a task with the id a23 and the label "Select next product". The second decision branch is executed if the condition is "". The first entry in in the second decision branch is a parallel gateway with 2 branches. The first entry in in the first parallel branch is a task with the id a25 and the label "Request courier". The first entry in in the second parallel branch is a task with the id a27 and the label "Pack products". At this point the parallel branches are joined. At this point we escape the innermost loop. At this point all decision branches are finished. Subsequently a task with the id a5 and the label "Withdraw product from warehouse" occurs. Subsequently a task with the id a17 and the label "Register product in stock management system" occurs, and the process ends.
