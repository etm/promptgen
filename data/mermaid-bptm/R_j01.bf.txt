The process contains the following main elements:
  * an infinite loop (no condidition), furthermore referred to as L1.
The loop L1 contains the following elements:
  * a task with the id a1 and the label "Collect machine information"
  * an infinite loop (no condidition), furthermore referred to as L2.
The loop L2 contains the following elements:
  * a task with the id a3 and the label "Calculate OEE"
  * an pre_test decision with 2 branches. This decision will be furthermore refered to as D1. 
    The first branch of D1 is executed if the condition is "OEE below threshold". 
    The second branch of D1 is executed if the condition is "OEE above threshold". 
After this the process ends.
