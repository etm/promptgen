First, an infinite loop (no condidition) occurs. Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a1 and the label "Collect machine information". Subsequently an infinite loop (no condidition) occurs. Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a3 and the label "Calculate OEE". Afterwards, this is followed by an pre_test decision with 2 branches. The first decision branch is executed if the condition is "OEE below threshold". The first entry in in the first decision branch is a task with the id a7 and the label "Stop machine". Then a task with the id a11 and the label "Send email to engineer" occurs. Subsequently an exclusive decision with 2 branches occurs. The first decision branch is executed if the condition is "Machine restarted". The first entry in in the first decision branch is a task with the id a1 and the label "Collect machine information". Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a3 and the label "Calculate OEE". The second decision branch is executed if the condition is "Machine disconnected". At this point we escape the innermost loop. At this point all decision branches are finished. The second decision branch is executed if the condition is "OEE above threshold". The only entry in the second decision branch is a task with the id a3 and the label "Calculate OEE". At this point all decision branches are finished, and the process ends.
