First, an infinite loop (no condidition) occurs. Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a2475 and the label "Customer provides chainsaw properties". Subsequently a parallel gateway with 3 branches, furthermore dubbed PG1, occurs. The first entry in in the first parallel branch of PG1 is a task with the id a2479 and the label "Order guide bar". The first entry in in the second parallel branch of PG1 is a task with the id a2481 and the label "Order chain width". The first entry in in the third parallel branch of PG1 is a task with the id a2483 and the label "Order chainsaw type". At this point the branches of PG1 are joined. Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a2491 and the label "Inspect parts". Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a2493 and the label "Assemble chainsaw". Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a2495 and the label "Send updates to customer". Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a2497 and the label "Send first chainsaw to customer". Subsequently an infinite loop (no condidition) occurs. Subsequently a task with the id a2503 and the label "Adjust chainsaw properties" occurs. Subsequently a task with the id a2475 and the label "Customer provides chainsaw properties" occurs. Subsequently, this is followed by a parallel gateway with 3 branches, furthermore dubbed PG2,. The first entry in in the first parallel branch of PG2 is a task with the id a2479 and the label "Order guide bar". The first entry in in the second parallel branch of PG2 is a task with the id a2481 and the label "Order chain width". The first entry in in the third parallel branch of PG2 is a task with the id a2483 and the label "Order chainsaw type". At this point the branches of PG2 are joined. Subsequently a task with the id a2491 and the label "Inspect parts" occurs. Subsequently a task with the id a2493 and the label "Assemble chainsaw" occurs. Then a task with the id a2495 and the label "Send updates to customer" occurs. Then a task with the id a2497 and the label "Send first chainsaw to customer" occurs. Subsequently a task with the id a2501 and the label "Produce rest of order" occurs, and the process ends.
