First, a task with the id a1201 and the label "Query all web shops for parts" occurs. Subsequently, this is followed by an exclusive decision with 2 branches. The first decision branch is executed if the condition is "If shop has enough parts". The only entry in the first decision branch is a task with the id a1205 and the label "Order parts from cheapest shop". The second decision branch is executed if the condition is "If shop doesn't have enough parts". The only entry in the second decision branch is a task with the id a1207 and the label "Order parts from several shops". At this point all decision branches are finished. Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a1209 and the label "Wait for parts to arrive". Then a task with the id a1213 and the label "Start building when first parts arrive" occurs. Subsequently, this is followed by an pre_test decision with 3 branches. The first decision branch is executed if the condition is "If stock falls below 5". The only entry in the first decision branch is a task with the id a1217 and the label "Reorder cheapest parts". The second decision branch is executed if the condition is "If stock falls below 3". The only entry in the second decision branch is a task with the id a1219 and the label "Reorder fastest parts". The third decision branch is executed if the condition is "". At this point we escape the innermost loop. At this point all decision branches are finished. Subsequently a task with the id a1221 and the label "Write a mail complaining about webshops" occurs, and the process ends.
