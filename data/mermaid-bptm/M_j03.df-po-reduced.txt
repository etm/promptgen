First, a task with the id a1 and the label "Query all web shops for parts" occurs. Then an exclusive decision with 2 branches occurs. The first decision branch is executed if the condition is "If shop has enough parts". The only entry in the first decision branch is a task with the id a5 and the label "Order parts from cheapest shop". The second decision branch is executed if the condition is "If shop doesn't have enough parts". The only entry in the second decision branch is a task with the id a7 and the label "Order parts from several shops". Following this, all decision branches are finished. Then a task with the id a9 and the label "Wait for parts to arrive" occurs. Then a task with the id a13 and the label "Start building when first parts arrive" occurs. Then an pre_test decision with 3 branches occurs. The first decision branch is executed if the condition is "If stock falls below 5". The only entry in the first decision branch is a task with the id a17 and the label "Reorder cheapest parts". The second decision branch is executed if the condition is "If stock falls below 3". The only entry in the second decision branch is a task with the id a19 and the label "Reorder fastest parts". At this point the innermost loop is exited. Following this, all decision branches are finished. Then a task with the id a21 and the label "Write a mail complaining about webshops" occurs, and the process ends.
