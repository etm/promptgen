First, a task with the id a2919 and the label "Claim is registered" occurs. Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a2920 and the label "Claim is examined". Subsequently, this is followed by an infinite loop (no condidition). Subsequently a task with the id a2921 and the label "Settlement recommendation is written" occurs. Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a2922 and the label "Recommendation is checked". Subsequently a loop, which starts if the condition "Not OK" is met, occurs. Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a2925 and the label "Claim is Not OK". Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a2921 and the label "Settlement recommendation is written". Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a2922 and the label "Recommendation is checked". Then a task with the id a2924 and the label "Claim is OK" occurs, and the process ends.
