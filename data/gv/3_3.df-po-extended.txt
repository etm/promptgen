First, a task with the id a2 and the label "Claim is registered" occurs. Then a task with the id a3 and the label "Claim is examined" occurs. Then an infinite loop (no condidition) occurs. Then a task with the id a4 and the label "Settlement recommendation is written" occurs. Then a task with the id a5 and the label "Recommendation is checked" occurs. Then a loop, which starts if the condition "Not OK" is met, occurs. Then a task with the id a8 and the label "Claim is Not OK" occurs. Then a task with the id a4 and the label "Settlement recommendation is written" occurs. Then a task with the id a5 and the label "Recommendation is checked" occurs. Then a task with the id a7 and the label "Claim is OK" occurs, and the process ends.
