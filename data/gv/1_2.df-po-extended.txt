First, a task with the id a2313 and the label "Customer brings in defective computer" occurs. Subsequently a task with the id a2314 and the label "CRS checks the defect" occurs. Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a2315 and the label "Repair cost calculation". Subsequently an exclusive decision with 2 branches occurs. This decision will be furthermore refered to as D1. The first branch of D1 is executed if the condition is "Costs are acceptable". The first entry in in the first branch of D1 is a task with the id a2317 and the label "Customer decides costs are acceptable". Subsequently, this is followed by a parallel gateway with 2 branches, furthermore dubbed PG1,. The first entry in in the first parallel branch of PG1 is a task with the id a2318 and the label "Check and repair hardware". The first entry in in the second parallel branch of PG1 is a task with the id a2319 and the label "Check and configure software". At this point the branches of PG1 are joined. Subsequently a task with the id a2322 and the label "Test system functionality" occurs. Subsequently a loop, which starts if the condition "Error detected" is met, occurs. Then a task with the id a2325 and the label "Execute arbitrary repair activity" occurs. Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a2322 and the label "Test system functionality". Then a task with the id a2324 and the label "Repair is finished" occurs. The second branch of D1 is executed if the condition is "Costs are not acceptable". At this point all branches of D1 are finished, and the process ends.
