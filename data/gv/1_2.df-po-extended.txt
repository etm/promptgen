First, a task with the id a3 and the label "Customer brings in defective computer" occurs. Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a4 and the label "CRS checks the defect". Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a5 and the label "Repair cost calculation". Afterwards, this is followed by an exclusive decision with 2 branches. This decision will be furthermore refered to as D1. The first branch of D1 is executed if the condition is "Costs are acceptable". The first entry in in the first branch of D1 is a task with the id a7 and the label "Customer decides costs are acceptable". Then a parallel gateway with 2 branches, furthermore dubbed PG1, occurs. The first entry in in the first parallel branch of PG1 is a task with the id a8 and the label "Check and repair hardware". The first entry in in the second parallel branch of PG1 is a task with the id a9 and the label "Check and configure software". At this point the branches of PG1 are joined. Afterwards, this is followed by an infinite loop (no condidition). Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a12 and the label "Test system functionality". Afterwards, this is followed by a loop, which starts if the condition "Error detected" is met,. Then a task with the id a15 and the label "Execute arbitrary repair activity" occurs. Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a12 and the label "Test system functionality". Then a task with the id a14 and the label "Repair is finished" occurs. The second branch of D1 is executed if the condition is "Costs are not acceptable". At this point all branches of D1 are finished, and the process ends.
