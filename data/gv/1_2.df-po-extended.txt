First, a task with the id a585 and the label "Customer brings in defective computer" occurs. Subsequently a task with the id a586 and the label "CRS checks the defect" occurs. Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a587 and the label "Repair cost calculation". Afterwards, this is followed by an exclusive decision with 2 branches. This decision will be furthermore refered to as D1. The first branch of D1 is executed if the condition is "Costs are acceptable". The first entry in in the first branch of D1 is a task with the id a589 and the label "Customer decides costs are acceptable". Subsequently, this is followed by a parallel gateway with 2 branches, furthermore dubbed PG1,. The first entry in in the first parallel branch of PG1 is a task with the id a590 and the label "Check and repair hardware". The first entry in in the second parallel branch of PG1 is a task with the id a591 and the label "Check and configure software". At this point the branches of PG1 are joined. Then a task with the id a594 and the label "Test system functionality" occurs. Subsequently, this is followed by a loop, which starts if the condition "Error detected" is met,. Subsequently a task with the id a597 and the label "Execute arbitrary repair activity" occurs. Then a task with the id a594 and the label "Test system functionality" occurs. Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a596 and the label "Repair is finished". The second branch of D1 is executed if the condition is "Costs are not acceptable". At this point all branches of D1 are finished, and the process ends.
