First, a task with the id a3 and the label "MPON sents the dismissal to the MPOO" occurs. Subsequently a task with the id a4 and the label "MPOO reviews the dismissal" occurs. Then an exclusive decision with 2 branches occurs. This decision will be furthermore refered to as D1. The first branch of D1 is executed if the condition is "Oppose". The only entry in the first branch of D1 is a task with the id a5 and the label "MPOO opposes the dismissal of MPON". The second branch of D1 is executed if the condition is "Confirm". The only entry in the second branch of D1 is a task with the id a6 and the label "MPOO confirmes the dismissal of the MPON". At this point all branches of D1 are finished, and the process ends.
