First, a task with the id a2 and the label "Claim is registered" occurs. Subsequently a task with the id a3 and the label "Claim is examined" occurs. Subsequently, this is followed by an infinite loop (no condidition). Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a4 and the label "Settlement recommendation is written". Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a5 and the label "Recommendation is checked". Subsequently a loop, which starts if the condition "Not OK" is met, occurs.
