First, a task with the id a578 and the label "MSPN sends dismissal" occurs. Then a task with the id a579 and the label "MSPO reviews dismissal" occurs. Subsequently an exclusive decision with 2 branches occurs. This decision will be furthermore refered to as D1. The first branch of D1 is executed if the condition is "Rejection". The only entry in the first branch of D1 is a task with the id a580 and the label "MSPO rejects dismissal". The second branch of D1 is executed if the condition is "Confirmation". The only entry in the second branch of D1 is a task with the id a581 and the label "MSPO confirms dismissal". At this point all branches of D1 are finished, and the process ends.
