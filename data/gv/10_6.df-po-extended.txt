First, a task with the id a2332 and the label "MSPN sends dismissal" occurs. Then a task with the id a2333 and the label "MSPO reviews dismissal" occurs. Afterwards, this is followed by an exclusive decision with 2 branches. This decision will be furthermore refered to as D1. The first branch of D1 is executed if the condition is "Rejection". The only entry in the first branch of D1 is a task with the id a2334 and the label "MSPO rejects dismissal". The second branch of D1 is executed if the condition is "Confirmation". The only entry in the second branch of D1 is a task with the id a2335 and the label "MSPO confirms dismissal". At this point all branches of D1 are finished, and the process ends.
