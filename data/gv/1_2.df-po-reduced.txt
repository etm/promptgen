First, a task with the id a1543 and the label "Customer brings in defective computer" occurs. Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a1544 and the label "CRS checks the defect". Then a task with the id a1545 and the label "Repair cost calculation" occurs. Subsequently an exclusive decision with 2 branches occurs. The first decision branch is executed if the condition is "Costs are acceptable". The first entry in in the first decision branch is a task with the id a1547 and the label "Customer decides costs are acceptable". Subsequently a parallel gateway with 2 branches occurs. The first entry in in the first parallel branch is a task with the id a1548 and the label "Check and repair hardware". The first entry in in the second parallel branch is a task with the id a1549 and the label "Check and configure software". At this point the parallel branches are joined. Afterwards, this is followed by an infinite loop (no condidition). Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a1552 and the label "Test system functionality". Subsequently a loop, which starts if the condition "Error detected" is met, occurs. Subsequently a task with the id a1555 and the label "Execute arbitrary repair activity" occurs. Then a task with the id a1552 and the label "Test system functionality" occurs. Subsequently a task with the id a1554 and the label "Repair is finished" occurs. The second decision branch is executed if the condition is "Costs are not acceptable". At this point all decision branches are finished, and the process ends.
