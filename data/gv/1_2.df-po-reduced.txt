First, a task with the id a3 and the label "Customer brings in defective computer" occurs. Then a task with the id a4 and the label "CRS checks the defect" occurs. Subsequently a task with the id a5 and the label "Repair cost calculation" occurs. Afterwards, this is followed by an exclusive decision with 2 branches. The first decision branch is executed if the condition is "Costs are acceptable". The first entry in in the first decision branch is a task with the id a7 and the label "Customer decides costs are acceptable". Afterwards, this is followed by a parallel gateway with 2 branches. The first entry in in the first parallel branch is a task with the id a8 and the label "Check and repair hardware". The first entry in in the second parallel branch is a task with the id a9 and the label "Check and configure software". At this point the parallel branches are joined. Subsequently, this is followed by an infinite loop (no condidition). Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a12 and the label "Test system functionality". Afterwards, this is followed by a loop, which starts if the condition "Error detected" is met,. Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a15 and the label "Execute arbitrary repair activity". Subsequently a task with the id a12 and the label "Test system functionality" occurs. Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a14 and the label "Repair is finished". The second decision branch is executed if the condition is "Costs are not acceptable". At this point all decision branches are finished, and the process ends.
