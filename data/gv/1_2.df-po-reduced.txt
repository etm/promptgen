First, a task with the id a1530 and the label "Customer brings in defective computer" occurs. Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a1531 and the label "CRS checks the defect". Then a task with the id a1532 and the label "Repair cost calculation" occurs. Afterwards, this is followed by an exclusive decision with 2 branches. The first decision branch is executed if the condition is "Costs are acceptable". The first entry in in the first decision branch is a task with the id a1534 and the label "Customer decides costs are acceptable". Afterwards, this is followed by a parallel gateway with 2 branches. The first entry in in the first parallel branch is a task with the id a1535 and the label "Check and repair hardware". The first entry in in the second parallel branch is a task with the id a1536 and the label "Check and configure software". At this point the parallel branches are joined. Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a1539 and the label "Test system functionality". Then a loop, which starts if the condition "Error detected" is met, occurs. Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a1542 and the label "Execute arbitrary repair activity". Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a1539 and the label "Test system functionality". Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a1541 and the label "Repair is finished". The second decision branch is executed if the condition is "Costs are not acceptable". At this point all decision branches are finished, and the process ends.
