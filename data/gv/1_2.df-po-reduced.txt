First, a task with the id a378 and the label "Customer brings in defective computer" occurs. Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a379 and the label "CRS checks the defect". Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a380 and the label "Repair cost calculation". Then an exclusive decision with 2 branches occurs. The first decision branch is executed if the condition is "Costs are acceptable". The first entry in in the first decision branch is a task with the id a382 and the label "Customer decides costs are acceptable". Afterwards, this is followed by a parallel gateway with 2 branches. The first entry in in the first parallel branch is a task with the id a383 and the label "Check and repair hardware". The first entry in in the second parallel branch is a task with the id a384 and the label "Check and configure software". At this point the parallel branches are joined. Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a387 and the label "Test system functionality". Subsequently a loop, which starts if the condition "Error detected" is met, occurs. Then a task with the id a390 and the label "Execute arbitrary repair activity" occurs. Then a task with the id a387 and the label "Test system functionality" occurs. Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a389 and the label "Repair is finished". The second decision branch is executed if the condition is "Costs are not acceptable". At this point all decision branches are finished, and the process ends.
