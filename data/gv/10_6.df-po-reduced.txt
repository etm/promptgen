First, a task with the id a371 and the label "MSPN sends dismissal" occurs. Then a task with the id a372 and the label "MSPO reviews dismissal" occurs. Afterwards, this is followed by an exclusive decision with 2 branches. The first decision branch is executed if the condition is "Rejection". The only entry in the first decision branch is a task with the id a373 and the label "MSPO rejects dismissal". The second decision branch is executed if the condition is "Confirmation". The only entry in the second decision branch is a task with the id a374 and the label "MSPO confirms dismissal". At this point all decision branches are finished, and the process ends.
