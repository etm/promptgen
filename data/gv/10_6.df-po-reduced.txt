First, a task with the id a4 and the label "MSPN sends dismissal" occurs. Then a task with the id a5 and the label "MSPO reviews dismissal" occurs. Then an exclusive decision with 2 branches occurs. The first decision branch is executed if the condition is "Rejection". The only entry in the first decision branch is a task with the id a6 and the label "MSPO rejects dismissal". The second decision branch is executed if the condition is "Confirmation". The only entry in the second decision branch is a task with the id a7 and the label "MSPO confirms dismissal". At this point all decision branches are finished, and the process ends.
