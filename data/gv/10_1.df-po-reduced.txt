First, a task with the id a3 and the label "MPON sents the dismissal to the MPOO" occurs. Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a4 and the label "MPOO reviews the dismissal". Afterwards, this is followed by an exclusive decision with 2 branches. The first decision branch is executed if the condition is "Oppose". The only entry in the first decision branch is a task with the id a5 and the label "MPOO opposes the dismissal of MPON". The second decision branch is executed if the condition is "Confirm". The only entry in the second decision branch is a task with the id a6 and the label "MPOO confirmes the dismissal of the MPON". At this point all decision branches are finished, and the process ends.
