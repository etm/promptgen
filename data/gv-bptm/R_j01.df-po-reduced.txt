First, an infinite loop (no condidition) occurs. Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a2012 and the label "Collect Information". Subsequently a task with the id a2013 and the label "Calculate OEE" occurs. Subsequently, this is followed by an exclusive decision with 2 branches. The first decision branch is executed if the condition is "OEE < Threshold". The first entry in in the first decision branch is a task with the id a2015 and the label "Stop Machine". Subsequently a task with the id a2016 and the label "Send Email" occurs. The second decision branch is executed if the condition is "OEE >= Threshold". At this point all decision branches are finished. Then a loop, which starts if the condition "Machine Restarted" is met, occurs. Subsequently a task with the id a2017 and the label "Restart Machine" occurs. Then a task with the id a2012 and the label "Collect Information" occurs. Subsequently a task with the id a2013 and the label "Calculate OEE" occurs. Then an post_test decision with 2 branches occurs. The first decision branch is executed if the condition is "OEE < Threshold". The first entry in in the first decision branch is a task with the id a2015 and the label "Stop Machine". Then a task with the id a2016 and the label "Send Email" occurs. The second decision branch is executed if the condition is "OEE >= Threshold". At this point all decision branches are finished. Subsequently a task with the id a2017 and the label "Restart Machine" occurs. Then a task with the id a2012 and the label "Collect Information" occurs. Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a2013 and the label "Calculate OEE", and the process ends.
