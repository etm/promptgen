First, a task with the id a1947 and the label "Develop Design" occurs. Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a1948 and the label "Order Lego Sets". Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a1949 and the label "Sort Parts". Afterwards, this is followed by an infinite loop (no condidition). Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a1950 and the label "Build Subcomponents". Then a loop, which starts if the condition "No more parts" is met, occurs. Subsequently a task with the id a1952 and the label "Reorder Parts" occurs. Subsequently a task with the id a1950 and the label "Build Subcomponents" occurs. Subsequently an infinite loop (no condidition) occurs. Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a1953 and the label "Test Subcomponents". Subsequently a loop, which starts if the condition "Test failed" is met, occurs. Then a task with the id a1955 and the label "Redesign and Rebuild" occurs. Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a1953 and the label "Test Subcomponents". Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a1956 and the label "Assemble", and the process ends.
