First, an infinite loop (no condidition) occurs. Subsequently a task with the id a1 and the label "Collect Information" occurs. Subsequently a task with the id a2 and the label "Calculate OEE" occurs. Then an exclusive decision with 2 branches occurs. This decision will be furthermore refered to as D1. The first branch of D1 is executed if the condition is "OEE < Threshold". The first entry in in the first branch of D1 is a task with the id a4 and the label "Stop Machine". Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a5 and the label "Send Email". The second branch of D1 is executed if the condition is "OEE >= Threshold". At this point all branches of D1 are finished. Subsequently a loop, which starts if the condition "Machine Restarted" is met, occurs. Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a6 and the label "Restart Machine". Subsequently a task with the id a1 and the label "Collect Information" occurs. Then a task with the id a2 and the label "Calculate OEE" occurs. Afterwards, this is followed by an post_test decision with 2 branches. This decision will be furthermore refered to as D2. The first branch of D2 is executed if the condition is "OEE < Threshold". The first entry in in the first branch of D2 is a task with the id a4 and the label "Stop Machine". Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a5 and the label "Send Email". The second branch of D2 is executed if the condition is "OEE >= Threshold". At this point all branches of D2 are finished. Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a6 and the label "Restart Machine". Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a1 and the label "Collect Information". Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a2 and the label "Calculate OEE", and the process ends.
