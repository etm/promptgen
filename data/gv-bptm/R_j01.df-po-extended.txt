First, an infinite loop (no condidition) occurs. Subsequently a task with the id a3076 and the label "Collect Information" occurs. Then a task with the id a3077 and the label "Calculate OEE" occurs. Then an exclusive decision with 2 branches occurs. This decision will be furthermore refered to as D1. The first branch of D1 is executed if the condition is "OEE < Threshold". The first entry in in the first branch of D1 is a task with the id a3079 and the label "Stop Machine". Subsequently a task with the id a3080 and the label "Send Email" occurs. The second branch of D1 is executed if the condition is "OEE >= Threshold". At this point all branches of D1 are finished. Subsequently a loop, which starts if the condition "Machine Restarted" is met, occurs. Subsequently a task with the id a3081 and the label "Restart Machine" occurs. Then a task with the id a3076 and the label "Collect Information" occurs. Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a3077 and the label "Calculate OEE". Then an post_test decision with 2 branches occurs. This decision will be furthermore refered to as D2. The first branch of D2 is executed if the condition is "OEE < Threshold". The first entry in in the first branch of D2 is a task with the id a3079 and the label "Stop Machine". Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a3080 and the label "Send Email". The second branch of D2 is executed if the condition is "OEE >= Threshold". At this point all branches of D2 are finished. Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a3081 and the label "Restart Machine". Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a3076 and the label "Collect Information". Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a3077 and the label "Calculate OEE", and the process ends.
