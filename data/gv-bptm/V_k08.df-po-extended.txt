Then an exclusive decision with 2 branches occurs. This decision will be furthermore refered to as D1. The first branch of D1 is executed if the condition is "Login Successful". The only entry in the first branch of D1 is an infinite loop (no condidition). The only entry in the first branch of D1 is a task with the id a3135 and the label "Select Products". The only entry in the first branch of D1 is a task with the id a3136 and the label "Add to Cart". The only entry in the first branch of D1 is a task with the id a3137 and the label "Save Product". The only entry in the first branch of D1 is a task with the id a3138 and the label "Check Selected Products". The only entry in the first branch of D1 is a loop, which starts if the condition "Not All Products Selected" is met,. The only entry in the first branch of D1 is a task with the id a3135 and the label "Select Products". The only entry in the first branch of D1 is a task with the id a3136 and the label "Add to Cart". The only entry in the first branch of D1 is a task with the id a3137 and the label "Save Product". The only entry in the first branch of D1 is a task with the id a3138 and the label "Check Selected Products". The only entry in the first branch of D1 is a task with the id a3139 and the label "Finish Order". The only entry in the first branch of D1 is a task with the id a3140 and the label "Prepare Payment and Shipment". The only entry in the first branch of D1 is a parallel gateway with 2 branches, furthermore dubbed PG1,. The first entry in in the first parallel branch of PG1 is a task with the id a3141 and the label "Enter Payment Data". Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a3142 and the label "Wait for Bank Confirmation". The first entry in in the second parallel branch of PG1 is a task with the id a3143 and the label "Enter Shipping Address". At this point the branches of PG1 are joined.
