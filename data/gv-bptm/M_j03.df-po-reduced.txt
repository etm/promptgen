First, a task with the id a2 and the label "Query web shops" occurs. Then an infinite loop (no condidition) occurs. Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a3 and the label "Order parts". Then a loop, which starts if the condition "Not enough parts" is met, occurs. Then a task with the id a3 and the label "Order parts" occurs. Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a10 and the label "Start building". Subsequently a task with the id a11 and the label "Check stock" occurs. Subsequently an exclusive decision with 3 branches occurs. The first decision branch is executed if the condition is "Stock < 5". The only entry in the first decision branch is a task with the id a7 and the label "Reorder parts (cheapest)". The second decision branch is executed if the condition is "Stock < 3". The only entry in the second decision branch is a task with the id a8 and the label "Reorder parts (fastest)". The third decision branch is executed if the condition is "Stock = 0". The only entry in the third decision branch is a task with the id a9 and the label "Complain to friends". At this point all decision branches are finished, and the process ends.
