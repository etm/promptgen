Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a3 and the label "Order parts". Then a task with the id a10 and the label "Start building" occurs. Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a11 and the label "Check stock". Subsequently an exclusive decision with 3 branches occurs. The first decision branch is executed if the condition is "Stock < 5". The only entry in the first decision branch is a task with the id a7 and the label "Reorder parts (cheapest)". The second decision branch is executed if the condition is "Stock < 3". The only entry in the second decision branch is a task with the id a8 and the label "Reorder parts (fastest)".
