First, an infinite loop (no condidition) occurs. Then a loop, which starts if the condition "Probation phase continues" is met, occurs. Subsequently an exclusive decision with 2 branches occurs. This decision will be furthermore refered to as D1. The first branch of D1 is executed if the condition is "After 1 year". The second branch of D1 is executed if the condition is "Before 1 year". At this point all branches of D1 are finished, and the process ends.
