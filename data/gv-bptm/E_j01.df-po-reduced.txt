First, an infinite loop (no condidition) occurs. Afterwards, this is followed by a loop, which starts if the condition "Probation phase continues" is met,. Then an exclusive decision with 2 branches occurs. The first decision branch is executed if the condition is "After 1 year". The second decision branch is executed if the condition is "Before 1 year". At this point all decision branches are finished, and the process ends.
