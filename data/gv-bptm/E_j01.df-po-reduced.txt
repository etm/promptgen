First, an infinite loop (no condidition) occurs. Then a loop, which starts if the condition "Probation phase continues" is met, occurs. Subsequently, this is followed by an exclusive decision with 2 branches. The first decision branch is executed if the condition is "After 1 year". The second decision branch is executed if the condition is "Before 1 year". At this point all decision branches are finished, and the process ends.
