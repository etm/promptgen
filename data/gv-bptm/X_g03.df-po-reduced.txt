First, a task with the id a2114 and the label "Select starting block" occurs. Then an infinite loop (no condidition) occurs. Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a2115 and the label "Run and measure time". Subsequently a loop, which starts if the condition "> 25 minutes" is met, occurs. Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a2117 and the label "Train and check". Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a2115 and the label "Run and measure time". Subsequently a task with the id a2118 and the label "Get starting number" occurs. Subsequently an exclusive decision with 2 branches occurs. The first decision branch is executed if the condition is "> 1 hour". The only entry in the first decision branch is a task with the id a2120 and the label "Go from home". The second decision branch is executed if the condition is "<= 1 hour". The only entry in the second decision branch is a task with the id a2121 and the label "Leave from work". At this point all decision branches are finished. Afterwards, this is followed by a parallel gateway with 2 branches. The first entry in in the first parallel branch is a task with the id a2123 and the label "Run at Night Run". The first entry in in the second parallel branch is a task with the id a2124 and the label "Drink at Night Run". At this point the parallel branches are joined. Subsequently a task with the id a2126 and the label "Receive final running time" occurs, and the process ends.
