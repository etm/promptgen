First, a task with the id a2 and the label "Identify resources" occurs. Then a task with the id a3 and the label "Create bot" occurs. Then an infinite loop (no condidition) occurs. Then a task with the id a4 and the label "Start farming" occurs. Then an pre_test decision with 3 branches occurs. The first decision branch is executed if the condition is "Disaster strikes". The first entry in in the first decision branch is a task with the id a5 and the label "Natural disaster". Then a task with the id a4 and the label "Start farming" occurs. The second decision branch is executed if the condition is "Milestone reached". The first entry in in the second decision branch is a task with the id a6 and the label "Reach milestone". Then an exclusive decision with 2 branches occurs. The first decision branch is executed if the condition is "More resources needed". The only entry in the first decision branch is a task with the id a4 and the label "Start farming". The second decision branch is executed if the condition is "All resources gathered". The first entry in in the second decision branch is a task with the id a8 and the label "Finish farming". Then a task with the id a9 and the label "Brag to friends" occurs. At this point the innermost loop is exited. Following this, all decision branches are finished. The third decision branch is executed if the condition is "Update resources". The first entry in in the third decision branch is a task with the id a7 and the label "Update resources". Then an exclusive decision with 2 branches occurs. The first decision branch is executed if the condition is "More resources needed". The only entry in the first decision branch is a task with the id a4 and the label "Start farming". The second decision branch is executed if the condition is "All resources gathered". The first entry in in the second decision branch is a task with the id a8 and the label "Finish farming". Then a task with the id a9 and the label "Brag to friends" occurs. At this point the innermost loop is exited. Following this, all decision branches are finished. Following this, all decision branches are finished, and the process ends.
