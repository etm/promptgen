First, a task with the id a1 and the label "Develop Design" occurs. Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a2 and the label "Order Lego Sets". Then a task with the id a3 and the label "Sort Parts" occurs. Subsequently an infinite loop (no condidition) occurs. Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a4 and the label "Build Subcomponents". Afterwards, this is followed by a loop, which starts if the condition "No more parts" is met,. Subsequently a task with the id a6 and the label "Reorder Parts" occurs. Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a4 and the label "Build Subcomponents". Subsequently an infinite loop (no condidition) occurs. Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a7 and the label "Test Subcomponents". Then a loop, which starts if the condition "Test failed" is met, occurs. Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a9 and the label "Redesign and Rebuild". Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a7 and the label "Test Subcomponents". Subsequently a task with the id a10 and the label "Assemble" occurs, and the process ends.
