First, a task with the id a3011 and the label "Develop Design" occurs. Subsequently a task with the id a3012 and the label "Order Lego Sets" occurs. Then a task with the id a3013 and the label "Sort Parts" occurs. Then an infinite loop (no condidition) occurs. Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a3014 and the label "Build Subcomponents". Then a loop, which starts if the condition "No more parts" is met, occurs. Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a3016 and the label "Reorder Parts". Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a3014 and the label "Build Subcomponents". Subsequently an infinite loop (no condidition) occurs. Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a3017 and the label "Test Subcomponents". Then a loop, which starts if the condition "Test failed" is met, occurs. Then a task with the id a3019 and the label "Redesign and Rebuild" occurs. Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a3017 and the label "Test Subcomponents". Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a3020 and the label "Assemble", and the process ends.
