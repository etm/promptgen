First, a task with the id a2087 and the label "Read order" occurs. Afterwards, this is followed by an infinite loop (no condidition). Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a2088 and the label "Check product stock". Afterwards, this is followed by an exclusive decision with 2 branches. The first decision branch is executed if the condition is "In stock". The only entry in the first decision branch is a task with the id a2089 and the label "Withdraw product". The second decision branch is executed if the condition is "Not in stock". The first entry in in the second decision branch is a task with the id a2090 and the label "Reorder product". Then a task with the id a2091 and the label "Wait for product" occurs. Afterwards, this is followed by an exclusive decision with 2 branches. The first decision branch is executed if the condition is "Wait > 10 days". The only entry in the first decision branch is a task with the id a2092 and the label "Demand penalty". The second decision branch is executed if the condition is "Wait <= 10 days". At this point all decision branches are finished. At this point all decision branches are finished. Subsequently a task with the id a2093 and the label "Register product" occurs. Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a2094 and the label "Check order status". Then an infinite loop (no condidition) occurs. Subsequently a task with the id a2088 and the label "Check product stock" occurs. Afterwards, this is followed by an exclusive decision with 2 branches. The first decision branch is executed if the condition is "In stock". The only entry in the first decision branch is a task with the id a2089 and the label "Withdraw product". The second decision branch is executed if the condition is "Not in stock". The first entry in in the second decision branch is a task with the id a2090 and the label "Reorder product". Subsequently a task with the id a2091 and the label "Wait for product" occurs. Then an exclusive decision with 2 branches occurs. The first decision branch is executed if the condition is "Wait > 10 days". The only entry in the first decision branch is a task with the id a2092 and the label "Demand penalty". The second decision branch is executed if the condition is "Wait <= 10 days". At this point all decision branches are finished. At this point all decision branches are finished. Then a task with the id a2093 and the label "Register product" occurs. Subsequently a task with the id a2094 and the label "Check order status" occurs. Then a task with the id a2095 and the label "Request courier and pack" occurs, and the process ends.
