Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a11 and the label "Check stock". Subsequently an exclusive decision with 3 branches occurs. This decision will be furthermore refered to as D1. The first branch of D1 is executed if the condition is "Stock < 5". The only entry in the first branch of D1 is a task with the id a7 and the label "Reorder parts (cheapest)". The second branch of D1 is executed if the condition is "Stock < 3". The only entry in the second branch of D1 is a task with the id a8 and the label "Reorder parts (fastest)". The third branch of D1 is executed if the condition is "Stock = 0". The only entry in the third branch of D1 is a task with the id a9 and the label "Complain to friends".
