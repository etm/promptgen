First, a task with the id a1 and the label "Select starting block" occurs. Afterwards, this is followed by an infinite loop (no condidition). Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a2 and the label "Run and measure time". Subsequently, this is followed by a loop, which starts if the condition "> 25 minutes" is met,. Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a4 and the label "Train and check". Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a2 and the label "Run and measure time". Subsequently a task with the id a5 and the label "Get starting number" occurs. Then an exclusive decision with 2 branches occurs. This decision will be furthermore refered to as D1. The first branch of D1 is executed if the condition is "> 1 hour". The only entry in the first branch of D1 is a task with the id a7 and the label "Go from home". The second branch of D1 is executed if the condition is "<= 1 hour". The only entry in the second branch of D1 is a task with the id a8 and the label "Leave from work". At this point all branches of D1 are finished. Subsequently a parallel gateway with 2 branches, furthermore dubbed PG1, occurs. The first entry in in the first parallel branch of PG1 is a task with the id a10 and the label "Run at Night Run". The first entry in in the second parallel branch of PG1 is a task with the id a11 and the label "Drink at Night Run". At this point the branches of PG1 are joined. Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a13 and the label "Receive final running time", and the process ends.
