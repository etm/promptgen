First, a task with the id a3178 and the label "Select starting block" occurs. Subsequently, this is followed by an infinite loop (no condidition). Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a3179 and the label "Run and measure time". Afterwards, this is followed by a loop, which starts if the condition "> 25 minutes" is met,. Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a3181 and the label "Train and check". Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a3179 and the label "Run and measure time". Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a3182 and the label "Get starting number". Afterwards, this is followed by an exclusive decision with 2 branches. This decision will be furthermore refered to as D1. The first branch of D1 is executed if the condition is "> 1 hour". The only entry in the first branch of D1 is a task with the id a3184 and the label "Go from home". The second branch of D1 is executed if the condition is "<= 1 hour". The only entry in the second branch of D1 is a task with the id a3185 and the label "Leave from work". At this point all branches of D1 are finished. Afterwards, this is followed by a parallel gateway with 2 branches, furthermore dubbed PG1,. The first entry in in the first parallel branch of PG1 is a task with the id a3187 and the label "Run at Night Run". The first entry in in the second parallel branch of PG1 is a task with the id a3188 and the label "Drink at Night Run". At this point the branches of PG1 are joined. Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a3190 and the label "Receive final running time", and the process ends.
