First, a task with the id a3151 and the label "Read order" occurs. Afterwards, this is followed by an infinite loop (no condidition). Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a3152 and the label "Check product stock". Afterwards, this is followed by an exclusive decision with 2 branches. This decision will be furthermore refered to as D1. The first branch of D1 is executed if the condition is "In stock". The only entry in the first branch of D1 is a task with the id a3153 and the label "Withdraw product". The second branch of D1 is executed if the condition is "Not in stock". The first entry in in the second branch of D1 is a task with the id a3154 and the label "Reorder product". Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a3155 and the label "Wait for product". Then an exclusive decision with 2 branches occurs. This decision will be furthermore refered to as D2. The first branch of D2 is executed if the condition is "Wait > 10 days". The only entry in the first branch of D2 is a task with the id a3156 and the label "Demand penalty". The second branch of D2 is executed if the condition is "Wait <= 10 days". At this point all branches of D2 are finished. At this point all branches of D1 are finished. Then a task with the id a3157 and the label "Register product" occurs. Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a3158 and the label "Check order status". Subsequently an infinite loop (no condidition) occurs. Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a3152 and the label "Check product stock". Subsequently an exclusive decision with 2 branches occurs. This decision will be furthermore refered to as D3. The first branch of D3 is executed if the condition is "In stock". The only entry in the first branch of D3 is a task with the id a3153 and the label "Withdraw product". The second branch of D3 is executed if the condition is "Not in stock". The first entry in in the second branch of D3 is a task with the id a3154 and the label "Reorder product". Then a task with the id a3155 and the label "Wait for product" occurs. Subsequently, this is followed by an exclusive decision with 2 branches. This decision will be furthermore refered to as D4. The first branch of D4 is executed if the condition is "Wait > 10 days". The only entry in the first branch of D4 is a task with the id a3156 and the label "Demand penalty". The second branch of D4 is executed if the condition is "Wait <= 10 days". At this point all branches of D4 are finished. At this point all branches of D3 are finished. Then a task with the id a3157 and the label "Register product" occurs. Subsequently a task with the id a3158 and the label "Check order status" occurs. Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a3159 and the label "Request courier and pack", and the process ends.
