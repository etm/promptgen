First, an infinite loop (no condidition) occurs. Then a task with the id a2 and the label "Customer provides properties" occurs. Subsequently a task with the id a3 and the label "Order parts online" occurs. Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a4 and the label "Inspect parts". Subsequently a task with the id a5 and the label "Assemble chainsaw" occurs. Subsequently a task with the id a6 and the label "Update customer" occurs. Then a task with the id a7 and the label "Send first chainsaw to customer" occurs. Subsequently a loop, which starts if the condition "Customer doesn't like it" is met, occurs. Then a task with the id a2 and the label "Customer provides properties" occurs. Then a task with the id a3 and the label "Order parts online" occurs. Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a4 and the label "Inspect parts". Subsequently a task with the id a5 and the label "Assemble chainsaw" occurs. Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a6 and the label "Update customer". Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a7 and the label "Send first chainsaw to customer". Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a9 and the label "Produce rest of order", and the process ends.
