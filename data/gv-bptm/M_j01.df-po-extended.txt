Subsequently a task with the id a3029 and the label "Send first chainsaw to customer" occurs. Then a loop, which starts if the condition "Customer doesn't like it" is met, occurs. Then a task with the id a3024 and the label "Customer provides properties" occurs. Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a3025 and the label "Order parts online". Subsequently a task with the id a3026 and the label "Inspect parts" occurs. Subsequently a task with the id a3027 and the label "Assemble chainsaw" occurs.
