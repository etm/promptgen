First, a task with the id a531 and the label "claims officer registers claim" occurs. Subsequently a task with the id a533 and the label "claims officer examines claim" occurs. Then an infinite loop (no condidition) occurs. Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a536 and the label "claims officer writes settlement recommendation". Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a537 and the label "senior claims officer checks recommendation". Then a task with the id a539 and the label "senior claims officer marks the claim" occurs. Subsequently an exclusive decision with 2 branches occurs. This decision will be furthermore refered to as D1. The first branch of D1 is executed if the condition is "nok". The only entry in the first branch of D1 is a task with the id a545 and the label "senior claims officer sends recommendation back". The second branch of D1 is executed if the condition is "ok". The first entry in in the second branch of D1 is a task with the id a543 and the label "the claim handling process proceeds". At this point we escape the innermost loop. At this point all branches of D1 are finished, and the process ends.
