First, a task with the id a2245 and the label "claims officer registers claim" occurs. Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a2247 and the label "claims officer examines claim". Afterwards, this is followed by an infinite loop (no condidition). Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a2250 and the label "claims officer writes settlement recommendation". Subsequently a task with the id a2251 and the label "senior claims officer checks recommendation" occurs. Then a task with the id a2253 and the label "senior claims officer marks the claim" occurs. Then an exclusive decision with 2 branches occurs. This decision will be furthermore refered to as D1. The first branch of D1 is executed if the condition is "nok". The only entry in the first branch of D1 is a task with the id a2259 and the label "senior claims officer sends recommendation back". The second branch of D1 is executed if the condition is "ok". The first entry in in the second branch of D1 is a task with the id a2257 and the label "the claim handling process proceeds". At this point we escape the innermost loop. At this point all branches of D1 are finished, and the process ends.
