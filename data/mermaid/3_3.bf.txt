The process contains the following main elements:
  * a task with the id a1 and the label "claims officer registers claim"
  * a task with the id a3 and the label "claims officer examines claim"
  * an infinite loop (no condidition), furthermore referred to as L1.
The loop L1 contains the following elements:
  * a task with the id a6 and the label "claims officer writes settlement recommendation"
  * a task with the id a7 and the label "senior claims officer checks recommendation"
  * a task with the id a9 and the label "senior claims officer marks the claim"
  * an exclusive decision with 2 branches. This decision will be furthermore refered to as D1. 
    The first branch of D1 is executed if the condition is "nok". 
    The second branch of D1 is executed if the condition is "ok". 
The first branch of D1 contains the following elements:
  * a task with the id a15 and the label "senior claims officer sends recommendation back"
The second branch of D1 contains the following elements:
  * a task with the id a13 and the label "the claim handling process proceeds"
  * at this point the innermost loop is exited. 
After this the process ends.
