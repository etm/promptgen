First, a task with the id a1 and the label "MPON sends the dismissal" occurs. Then a task with the id a3 and the label "MPOO reviews the dismissal" occurs. Then an exclusive decision with 2 branches occurs. The only entry in the first decision branch is a task with the id a7 and the label "MPOO opposes the dismissal". The only entry in the second decision branch is a task with the id a9 and the label "MPOO confirmes the dismissal". At this point all decision branches are finished, and the process ends.
