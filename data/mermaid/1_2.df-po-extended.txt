First, a task with the id a2169 and the label "customer brings defective computer" occurs. Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a2171 and the label "the crs checks the defect". Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a2173 and the label "the crs hands out repair cost calculation". Subsequently, this is followed by an exclusive decision with 2 branches. This decision will be furthermore refered to as D1. The first branch of D1 is executed if the condition is "not aceptable". The only entry in the first branch of D1 is a task with the id a2177 and the label "customer takes computer home". The second branch of D1 is executed if the condition is "aceptable". The first entry in in the second branch of D1 is the start of a loop. Subsequently, this is followed by a parallel gateway with 2 branches, furthermore dubbed PG1,. The first entry in in the first parallel branch of PG1 is a task with the id a2185 and the label "check the hardware". Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a2187 and the label "repair the hardware". The first entry in in the second parallel branch of PG1 is a task with the id a2189 and the label "checks the software". Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a2191 and the label "configures the software". At this point the branches of PG1 are joined. Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a2192 and the label "test system functionality". At this point we loop back, if the condition "error detected" evaluates to true. Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a2195 and the label "repair is finished". At this point all branches of D1 are finished, and the process ends.
