First, a task with the id a1 and the label "customer brings defective computer" occurs. Subsequently a task with the id a3 and the label "the crs checks the defect" occurs. Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a5 and the label "the crs hands out repair cost calculation". Then an exclusive decision with 2 branches occurs. This decision will be furthermore refered to as D1. The first branch of D1 is executed if the condition is "not aceptable". The only entry in the first branch of D1 is a task with the id a9 and the label "customer takes computer home". The second branch of D1 is executed if the condition is "aceptable". The first entry in in the second branch of D1 is the start of a loop. Afterwards, this is followed by a parallel gateway with 2 branches, furthermore dubbed PG1,. The first entry in in the first parallel branch of PG1 is a task with the id a17 and the label "check the hardware". Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a19 and the label "repair the hardware". The first entry in in the second parallel branch of PG1 is a task with the id a21 and the label "checks the software". Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a23 and the label "configures the software". At this point the branches of PG1 are joined. Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a24 and the label "test system functionality". At this point we loop back, if the condition "error detected" evaluates to true. Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a27 and the label "repair is finished". At this point all branches of D1 are finished, and the process ends.
