First, a task with the id a1 and the label "MSPN sends dismissal" occurs. Then a task with the id a3 and the label "MSPO reviews the dismissal" occurs. Then an exclusive decision with 2 branches occurs. The only entry in the first decision branch is a task with the id a7 and the label "MSPO rejects the dismissal". The only entry in the second decision branch is a task with the id a9 and the label "MSPO confirms the dismissal". Following this, all decision branches are finished, and the process ends.
