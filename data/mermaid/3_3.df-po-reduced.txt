First, a task with the id a1181 and the label "claims officer registers claim" occurs. Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a1183 and the label "claims officer examines claim". Subsequently an infinite loop (no condidition) occurs. Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a1186 and the label "claims officer writes settlement recommendation". Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a1187 and the label "senior claims officer checks recommendation". Then a task with the id a1189 and the label "senior claims officer marks the claim" occurs. Then an exclusive decision with 2 branches occurs. The first decision branch is executed if the condition is "nok". The only entry in the first decision branch is a task with the id a1195 and the label "senior claims officer sends recommendation back". The second decision branch is executed if the condition is "ok". The first entry in in the second decision branch is a task with the id a1193 and the label "the claim handling process proceeds". At this point we escape the innermost loop. At this point all decision branches are finished, and the process ends.
