First, a task with the id a324 and the label "claims officer registers claim" occurs. Then a task with the id a326 and the label "claims officer examines claim" occurs. Subsequently, this is followed by an infinite loop (no condidition). Subsequently a task with the id a329 and the label "claims officer writes settlement recommendation" occurs. Then a task with the id a330 and the label "senior claims officer checks recommendation" occurs. Then a task with the id a332 and the label "senior claims officer marks the claim" occurs. Afterwards, this is followed by an exclusive decision with 2 branches. The first decision branch is executed if the condition is "nok". The only entry in the first decision branch is a task with the id a338 and the label "senior claims officer sends recommendation back". The second decision branch is executed if the condition is "ok". The first entry in in the second decision branch is a task with the id a336 and the label "the claim handling process proceeds". At this point we escape the innermost loop. At this point all decision branches are finished, and the process ends.
