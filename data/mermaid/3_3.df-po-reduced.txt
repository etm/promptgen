First, a task with the id a900 and the label "claims officer registers claim" occurs. Then a task with the id a902 and the label "claims officer examines claim" occurs. Then an infinite loop (no condidition) occurs. Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a905 and the label "claims officer writes settlement recommendation". Then a task with the id a906 and the label "senior claims officer checks recommendation" occurs. Subsequently a task with the id a908 and the label "senior claims officer marks the claim" occurs. Subsequently an exclusive decision with 2 branches occurs. The first decision branch is executed if the condition is "nok". The only entry in the first decision branch is a task with the id a914 and the label "senior claims officer sends recommendation back". The second decision branch is executed if the condition is "ok". The first entry in in the second decision branch is a task with the id a912 and the label "the claim handling process proceeds". At this point we escape the innermost loop. At this point all decision branches are finished, and the process ends.
