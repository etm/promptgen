First, a task with the id a913 and the label "claims officer registers claim" occurs. Then a task with the id a915 and the label "claims officer examines claim" occurs. Afterwards, this is followed by an infinite loop (no condidition). Then a task with the id a918 and the label "claims officer writes settlement recommendation" occurs. Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a919 and the label "senior claims officer checks recommendation". Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a921 and the label "senior claims officer marks the claim". Then an exclusive decision with 2 branches occurs. The first decision branch is executed if the condition is "nok". The only entry in the first decision branch is a task with the id a927 and the label "senior claims officer sends recommendation back". The second decision branch is executed if the condition is "ok". The first entry in in the second decision branch is a task with the id a925 and the label "the claim handling process proceeds". At this point we escape the innermost loop. At this point all decision branches are finished, and the process ends.
