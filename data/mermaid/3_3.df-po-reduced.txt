First, a task with the id a1 and the label "claims officer registers claim" occurs. Then a task with the id a3 and the label "claims officer examines claim" occurs. Then an infinite loop (no condidition) occurs. Then a task with the id a6 and the label "claims officer writes settlement recommendation" occurs. Then a task with the id a7 and the label "senior claims officer checks recommendation" occurs. Then a task with the id a9 and the label "senior claims officer marks the claim" occurs. Then an exclusive decision with 2 branches occurs. The first decision branch is executed if the condition is "nok". The only entry in the first decision branch is a task with the id a15 and the label "senior claims officer sends recommendation back". The second decision branch is executed if the condition is "ok". The first entry in in the second decision branch is a task with the id a13 and the label "the claim handling process proceeds". At this point the innermost loop is exited. Following this, all decision branches are finished, and the process ends.
