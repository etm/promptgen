First, a task with the id a1 and the label "customer brings defective computer" occurs. Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a3 and the label "the crs checks the defect". Then a task with the id a5 and the label "the crs hands out repair cost calculation" occurs. Then an exclusive decision with 2 branches occurs. The first decision branch is executed if the condition is "not aceptable". The only entry in the first decision branch is a task with the id a9 and the label "customer takes computer home". The second decision branch is executed if the condition is "aceptable". The first entry in in the second decision branch is the start of a loop. Subsequently a parallel gateway with 2 branches occurs. The first entry in in the first parallel branch is a task with the id a17 and the label "check the hardware". Subsequently a task with the id a19 and the label "repair the hardware" occurs. The first entry in in the second parallel branch is a task with the id a21 and the label "checks the software". Subsequently a task with the id a23 and the label "configures the software" occurs. At this point the parallel branches are joined. Subsequently a task with the id a24 and the label "test system functionality" occurs. At this point we loop back, if the condition "error detected" evaluates to true. Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a27 and the label "repair is finished". At this point all decision branches are finished, and the process ends.
