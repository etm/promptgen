First, a task with the id a837 and the label "customer brings defective computer" occurs. Subsequently a task with the id a839 and the label "the crs checks the defect" occurs. Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a841 and the label "the crs hands out repair cost calculation". Afterwards, this is followed by an exclusive decision with 2 branches. The first decision branch is executed if the condition is "not aceptable". The only entry in the first decision branch is a task with the id a845 and the label "customer takes computer home". The second decision branch is executed if the condition is "aceptable". The first entry in in the second decision branch is the start of a loop. Then a parallel gateway with 2 branches occurs. The first entry in in the first parallel branch is a task with the id a853 and the label "check the hardware". Then a task with the id a855 and the label "repair the hardware" occurs. The first entry in in the second parallel branch is a task with the id a857 and the label "checks the software". Subsequently a task with the id a859 and the label "configures the software" occurs. At this point the parallel branches are joined. Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a860 and the label "test system functionality". At this point we loop back, if the condition "error detected" evaluates to true. Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a863 and the label "repair is finished". At this point all decision branches are finished, and the process ends.
