First, a task with the id a824 and the label "customer brings defective computer" occurs. Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a826 and the label "the crs checks the defect". Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a828 and the label "the crs hands out repair cost calculation". Afterwards, this is followed by an exclusive decision with 2 branches. The first decision branch is executed if the condition is "not aceptable". The only entry in the first decision branch is a task with the id a832 and the label "customer takes computer home". The second decision branch is executed if the condition is "aceptable". The first entry in in the second decision branch is the start of a loop. Subsequently, this is followed by a parallel gateway with 2 branches. The first entry in in the first parallel branch is a task with the id a840 and the label "check the hardware". Subsequently a task with the id a842 and the label "repair the hardware" occurs. The first entry in in the second parallel branch is a task with the id a844 and the label "checks the software". Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a846 and the label "configures the software". At this point the parallel branches are joined. Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a847 and the label "test system functionality". At this point we loop back, if the condition "error detected" evaluates to true. Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a850 and the label "repair is finished". At this point all decision branches are finished, and the process ends.
