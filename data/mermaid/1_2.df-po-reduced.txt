First, a task with the id a1105 and the label "customer brings defective computer" occurs. Then a task with the id a1107 and the label "the crs checks the defect" occurs. Then a task with the id a1109 and the label "the crs hands out repair cost calculation" occurs. Subsequently an exclusive decision with 2 branches occurs. The first decision branch is executed if the condition is "not aceptable". The only entry in the first decision branch is a task with the id a1113 and the label "customer takes computer home". The second decision branch is executed if the condition is "aceptable". The first entry in in the second decision branch is the start of a loop. Subsequently, this is followed by a parallel gateway with 2 branches. The first entry in in the first parallel branch is a task with the id a1121 and the label "check the hardware". Subsequently, this is followed by a task with the id a1123 and the label "repair the hardware". The first entry in in the second parallel branch is a task with the id a1125 and the label "checks the software". Then a task with the id a1127 and the label "configures the software" occurs. At this point the parallel branches are joined. Then a task with the id a1128 and the label "test system functionality" occurs. At this point we loop back, if the condition "error detected" evaluates to true. Afterwards, this is followed by a task with the id a1131 and the label "repair is finished". At this point all decision branches are finished, and the process ends.
